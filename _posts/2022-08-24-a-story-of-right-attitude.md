_*What message does this incident give us?*_

*Taj Hotel*

The terror attack on the Taj Hotel has become a major case study in psychology at Harvard. It came as a surprise to everyone that not a single Taj employee ran away from the hotel, but they all stayed there during the attack. All the staff members were engaged in evacuating the guests safely and many employees lost their lives in the process. Such behaviour by the staff at Taj had taken the psychologists by surprise. 

It is a wonderful story of efficient leadership and devotion to duty in times of extreme mental stress, and this incident is hardly taught as a case study in any management institute. It is very important what our future generations learn from this incident and how they adopt it in their life‚Ä¶

On *26 November 2008*, a group of 10 terrorists attacked the city of Mumbai. They broke up into teams to attack at different locations. One of those locations was the iconic, beautiful, 103 year old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in South Mumbai. There was absolute destruction in that hotel for three nights and two days. Many people were injured or killed during that terror attack. This group of terrorists was roaming freely in this old hotel with automatic weapons, explosives and grenades in bags. Many of us may have seen or heard that coverage on television.

At around 9:00 pm on 26 November, an explosion occurred at the Leopold Cafe, less than 200 meters from the Taj. Two young men pulled out automatic weapons and started firing. The people on the streets started panicking. Two heavily armed terrorists entered the lobby of the Taj, bypassing the metal detectors. They were soon joined by the two attackers from Leopold, who had entered through a back door.

According to Hemant Oberoi who is a very old chef there, at 9:35 or 9:40 he got a call from a chef. He was told on the phone that there's firing going on and a man has been shot dead outside the restaurant. While still talking on the phone, they heard another gunshot and Hemant asked the chef on the phone to close all the doors of the restaurant. The terrorists were banging on the doors. They were asking everyone to come out, threatening to shoot them. Some of the guests got very scared, and they went out with their hands up. The terrorists started hitting and harassing them.

The whole scene was very scary. No one could understand exactly what was happening in the hotel. There was a war like situation inside the hotel. The sound of grenades and gunfire could be heard all around.

Karambir Singh Kang, who was at a high position in the Taj Hotel, said that no one could understand where the attack was coming from. No one knew in which part of the hotel the terrorists were at that time. There was chaos all around. A lot of the hotel staff were stuck with guests at various places and were calling Karambir Singh Kang, asking what they should do next. 

The Taj staff remained inside the hotel throughout the incident, pacifying the frightened guests and evacuating them all. They would lead the guests out of the hotel and then come back inside to help other stranded guests. The hotel's team of telephone operators, who were asked to vacate the hotel, returned to their stations voluntarily and stayed the whole night.

Among the guests at Taj that night were members of Unilever's global board of directors and senior management team, who had come with their spouses to honour the new CEO and the retiring CEO. According to Leena Nair, a guest at the Taj Hotel, they all had a seven-course meal. There was a warmth, there was laughter. Everyone was happy for the new CEO, and getting emotional on the farewell of the retiring CEO. When they heard explosions from outside, it sounded like firecrackers to them.

According to Leena Nair, all of them were there all night. She said, "All night we were sitting with our hearts in our mouths, with debris falling all around, the sounds of firing all around. The hotel staff maintained composure and would come to us asking calmly, "Do you want water? Do you want to say something to us?" According to Leena Nair, the level of calm and composure displayed by the staff was amazing.

Manager Mallika Jagad said that the entire corridor outside the hall was on fire, so there was no way they could get out. The firefighters were outside and they were putting out the fire on the sixth floor.

During this incident, Karambir Singh Kang lost his wife and two young sons who were in their living quarters on the sixth floor of the hotel, due to a fire on that floor.

Ratan Tata, the owner of the Taj Hotel, said that no one knew what to do in such circumstances. No instructions were being given to anyone. It seemed that everyone, from the waiters to the restaurant's managers, had only one goal of how to get the guests out safely.

On the night of 26 November, 500 guests were staying at that hotel. 600 or more guests were either at the Taj's various restaurants or had come to participate in the various functions that took place inside the Taj Hotel. About 600 or more Taj Hotel employees were working inside the hotel that night‚Äîmost of them in their 20s to 30s. Some of these staff members had only been working for a few years at this hotel. Many of them were parents of very young children. Some were the only earning members in their families, some had children waiting for them at home. 

*All 600 of these employees knew all the routes to the Taj Hotel. They knew all the exits and entrances. They knew how to get out safely.* All research in psychology says that in the time of such terror, every person wants to run away safely from that place.

Harvard professor Rohit Deshpande says that when he was working on this case study, he asked the students, "How many of these employs do you think may have left the guests  and fled, and how many of them would have stayed?" 

All the students guess that the maximum number of employees would have left the hotel. Or only about a quarter, about 150 would be left behind. 

*But the truth is that not a single employee ran away from the hotel that night.* While all the employees knew how to get out safely. They all stayed with the guests in the hotel and their only goal was how to get the guests out safely.

The professor asked the senior management of the hotel what was the reason that every employee of the hotel was only thinking about the safety of the guests. And most of these employees were young. The hotel management also could not answer this. Even Mr. Ratan Tata, the head of the Tata group of companies and the owner of Taj Hotels, could not give a clear answer to this question. That's why they teach it as a case study at Harvard, according to the professor.

According to him, when he asks the students how the students see this incident. Some of them say, "The culture of India is that the guest is to be treated like God. _Atithi Devo Bhava_ ." Some other students say, "No, no, it's not the national culture, it's the corporate culture. The Tata group has a long history of very benevolent Human Resource policies in India. It's the corporate culture." And others say, "No, this is not corporate culture. This incident happened in a hotel. Here the staff is trained to serve every guest who comes to the hotel."

To find out the secret, the professor and his colleague met the recruitment team at the Taj Hotel - that selects the hotel staff. They were asked on what basis employees are hired here, and how do they motivate and train them?

According to the professor, a lot could be learned from what the recruitment team shared.

The professor continued his point and said, "First of all we were told about the selection of employees. They do not recruit their frontline staff from high schools in big cities like Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta or Madras, rather recruit from smaller cities like Haldia, Chandigarh, Nashik, Tiruchipalli. *And they recruit these students keeping in mind their attitude and not their grades.* They try to know about their behaviour from their headmaster or teachers before selecting frontline employees. They select those students who have a sense of respect for older people, their parents, and teachers. 

He further explains that everyone must have heard about brand ambassadors. Many companies and organizations train their frontline staff to be ambassadors for the brand, for the company. But this is not the case with Taj hotels, they train their frontline staff very differently to be ambassadors for customers, for guests. They call them "guest ambassadors". They believe that the frontline staff should be the representative of the customer, of every guest who comes to the hotel.

And third, and perhaps most important, their reward system. The reward is not just in the form of money, but in the form of recognition! This motivates hotel staff to do good work. They reward their employees with personal recognition. So when an employee does something that delights customers and when the guest writes about that employee in the feedback form, within 48 hours that employee is recognised. They don't have to wait for Diwali or Christmas. This is done within 48 hours!

Taj Hotels won the International Hermes Award for Innovation in Human Resource Management for the *STARS* programme.
      
*Things we can learn here are..*

The way every customer and guest visiting the Taj Hotel is treated, we can say that it reflects the creation of customer-centric, guest-centred corporate culture, organizational culture. This incident reflects a positive relationship and contract between employer and employee. And finally, we can end by saying that this is a wonderful, inspiring event that was considered a symbol of a terrorist attack, but has become a source of hope and inspiration today.
