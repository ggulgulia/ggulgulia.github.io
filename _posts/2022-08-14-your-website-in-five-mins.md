## Prerequisites
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account
2. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) account - _optional_ - only if you want users to send you messages

## Step 1: Fork a Jekyll web project
There are many [free](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) and paid Jekyll Themes available.  You could choose any; however, 
for this setup you need to [fork this project](https://github.com/aakashshah1/aakashshah1.github.io/fork).
Use the name `<your-github-user-name>.github.io` for this project - for ex. if my GitHub user name is `aakashshah1`; I
would name the project `aakashshah1.github.io`.

## Step 2: Edit the `_config.yaml`
Make the necessary changes to the `# site-settings` section of the `_config.yaml` file in the project and save it.

## Step 3: Deploy your site
Go to `Settings` tab of the project and visit the `Pages` section from the sidebar.  
In the `Build and Deployment > Branch` section; select `main` and click `Save`.
At this point the deployment for your site would have started which you can check in the `Actions` tab.
Once the deployment is completed; you can check out your website by going to `https://your-github-username.github.io`.

_Thats it folks!!_
